# github-classifier unit tests

**short description**

The unit tests test_ATE_Converter.py, test_ETM_Converter.py, and test_Custom_Dataset.py in this folder have to be moved to the same directory as the Pipeline and its components for execution.
It is assumed that the unit_tests remain in this folder, otherwise the paths in the different testing functions will have to be manually adjusted.

autopep8
