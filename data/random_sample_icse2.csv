We also explored two choices of number of T1 weighted images of four and five for native T1, selected to allow training of network using existing data from modified Look-Locker sequences (MOLLI). After a rigorous training using in-vivo T1 maps of 607 patients, undergoing clinical cardiac MR exams, collected by MOLLI, the performance of MyoMapNet was evaluated using in-vivo data of 61 patients by discarding the additional T1-weighted images from MOLLI. Subsequently, we implemented LL4 T1 mapping sequence and an inline implementation of MyoMapNet on a 3T Siemens scanner to imaging and inline reconstruction of T1 maps. The inline MyoMapNet was then used to collect LL4 T1 and MOLLI in 16 subjects to demonstrate feasibility of inline MyoMapNet.",7722,67,6,4,TODO: <>,TODO: <>,,,

Introduction: This is a tensorflow implementation of paper(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01174.pdf) Nonparallel Emotional Speech Conversion. It is an end-to-end voice conversion system which can change the speaker's emotion. For example, neutral to angry, sad to happy. The model aims at generating speech with desired emotions while keeping the original linguistic content and speaker identity. It first extracts acoustic features from raw audio, then learn the mapping from source emotion to target emotion in the feature space, and finally put those features together to rebuild the waveform. In our approach, three types of features are considered: Features: Fundamental frequency (log F_0), converted by logarithm Gaussian normalized transformation Power envelope, converted by logarithm Gaussian normalized transformation Mel-cepstral coefficients (MCEPs), a representation of spectral envelope, trained by CycleGAN Aperiodicities (APs), directly used without modification.

This library is intended to be easily inserted into a standard scientific software stack as well as to allow for more direct interaction of Timepix3 with interactive flavors of Python. Included with the library are two example programs using PymePix: PymePix-acq is a command line control and acquisition program that can capture UDP packets and decode them into pixels and triggers.
