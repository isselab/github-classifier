Introduction: This is a tensorflow implementation of paper(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01174.pdf) Nonparallel Emotional Speech Conversion. It is an end-to-end voice conversion system which can change the speaker's emotion. For example, neutral to angry, sad to happy. The model aims at generating speech with desired emotions while keeping the original linguistic content and speaker identity. It first extracts acoustic features from raw audio, then learn the mapping from source emotion to target emotion in the feature space, and finally put those features together to rebuild the waveform. In our approach, three types of features are considered: Features: Fundamental frequency (log F_0), converted by logarithm Gaussian normalized transformation Power envelope, converted by logarithm Gaussian normalized transformation Mel-cepstral coefficients (MCEPs), a representation of spectral envelope, trained by CycleGAN Aperiodicities (APs), directly used without modification.

In order to increase the growth of rice in the rice crop it is necessary to detect the weed and insects in the rice crop to minimize the growth of weed and insects so that the growth of the rice can be increased.Insect and Weed detection is the important factor to be analyzed. Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) is used for data acquisition of rice crop in different phases and states so that high quality of RGB images can be captured. In which we have taken 15 different types of rice crop insects species images and different phases of weed images to train the model. The proposed method facilitates the extraction of weed and insects into the rice crop ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½eld using deep learning concept faster region-based convolutional neural networks(Faster R-CNNs) it is implemented using Python3 with the help of Tensorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½½tth good accuracy rate.,,25,Python,242447,1847,6,911,,,,,,,,

Our contributions include: (a) A novel and compact 2D pose NSRM representation. (b) A human body orientation classifier and an ensemble of orientation-tuned neural networks that regress the 3D human pose by also allowing for the decomposition of the body to an upper and lower kinematic hierarchy. This permits the recovery of the human pose even in the case of significant occlusions. (c) An efficient Inverse Kinematics solver that refines the neural-network-based solution providing 3D human pose estimations that are consistent with the limb sizes of a target person (if known). All the above yield a 33% accuracy improvement on the Human 3.6 Million (H3.6M) dataset compared to the baseline method (MocapNET) while maintaining real-time performance",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgz1MRq-I-k,737,C++,14608,99,0,61,,,,,,,,
